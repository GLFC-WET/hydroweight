Description: Implements workflows to compute spatially explicit landscape metrics 
    described in Peterson et al. (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02507.x>. 
    Uses previously generated terrain products (examples provided) and a user- 
    defined weighting function to produce distance-weighted rasters. Weighted rasters 
    and landscape layers are then used to produce distance-weighted landscape attributes.
